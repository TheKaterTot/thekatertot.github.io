      <div class="space-left">
      <p>
        Completing Module 1 at Turing is a bit like completing the first leg of
        a relay race--except that you’re handing off the baton to yourself. You
        hope that the version of you who accepts the baton is better and faster
        and smarter, but you’ll settle for someone who is at least trying to be
        all of those things. Mod 1 reveals all of our strengths and weaknesses;
        it makes us more human while we try to push ourselves to be more than that.

        I learned more about programming in those first six weeks than I had in
        years of self-teaching and online aids. My favorite topic somehow became
        recursion, and my family got tired of hearing about the stack and my many
        stack overflow errors. But even when my dry eyes closed after an especially
        long day of wading through a new project, I dreamt of the stack. Through
        this fascination, I endured the projects--but it wasn’t until my third
        implementation of recursion that I could finally trace it from end to end.
        That moment was so satisfying--I had passed off the baton to a version
        of myself that understood recursion.

      <h3 id="left-align">Transaction</h3>
      <div class="space-left">
        <p>
          I recently learned how to use a transaction block, and I am so glad I did.
          Given that I needed to make several queries dependent on each other, it
          turned out to be the best tool for my needs. Simply put, transactions are
          blocks where SQL statements are only permanent if they are all successful.
          If one fails, they all fail, which worked for me because I didn't need a
          half-formed object floating around in my database.
        </p><br />
        <p>
          Because transactions only succeed if every statement succeeds, I found it
          best to use the bang on my create actions (the only actions in my transaction,
          in this case). If the transaction failed, I could rely on the bang to raise
          an exception, and I could also specify what to return should it raise that
          error. For my purposes, I only needed to return true if it was successful
          and false if it wasn't. The transaction block helped me build an efficient
          method that performed the queries I needed while also providing a reliable
          boolean value.

      <h3 id="left-align">Open Source Contribution</h3>
      <div class="space-left">
        <p>
          I love open source. I wouldn't have survived college without Linux and
          OpenOffice. I think we can only get better if we share what we know with
          each other. Still, setting out to contribute to open source was a little
          daunting--there are so many projects, and all of the issues seemed to
          be drowning in context I didn't have. Many of the tools I use, like
          Postgres or Faraday or even Pry, had issues with long comment threads
          and academic conversations I didn't feel capable of participating in.
        </p><br />
        <p>
          I did find some projects that were more accessible for new developers,
          but they weren't necessarily tools I had used, and I really wanted to
          contribute to a project I was invested in. Luckily, I'm working on a
          side project, and I found a small bug in one of the libraries I was using.
          The maintainer fixed the bug quickly, but I realized that the module
          didn't have any tests. Hallelujah--a tool I used that needed me.
        </p><br />
        <p>
          In writing the tests, there were a lot of things to consider. I used
          my background in editing to match the style of the original code in my
          tests. The goal of editing is the same as being a code contributor: be
          concise, match tone and style, and leave the work better than when you
          arrived.
