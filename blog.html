      <div>
      <p>
        Completing Module 1 at Turing is a bit like completing the first leg of
        a relay race--except that you’re handing off the baton to yourself. You
        hope that the version of you who accepts the baton is better and faster
        and smarter, but you’ll settle for someone who is at least trying to be
        all of those things. Mod 1 reveals all of our strengths and weaknesses;
        it makes us more human while we try to push ourselves to be more than that.

        I learned more about programming in those first six weeks than I had in
        years of self-teaching and online aids. My favorite topic somehow became
        recursion, and my family got tired of hearing about the stack and my many
        stack overflow errors. But even when my dry eyes closed after an especially
        long day of wading through a new project, I dreamt of the stack. Through
        this fascination, I endured the projects--but it wasn’t until my third
        implementation of recursion that I could finally trace it from end to end.
        That moment was so satisfying--I had passed off the baton to a version
        of myself that understood recursion.
